>/SideQuests/
## 🧭 Welcome to Side Quests
The directory where all the fun, chaotic, non-sense projects go.\
This is the land of “what if…”, late-night experiments, and things I build when I'm not busy pretending to be academically responsible.

### 📍 What lives here?
- Tiny experiments that grew out of boredom 
- Over-engineered tools nobody asked for 
- Personal labs, tests, and tech doodles 
- Ideas too weird for formal projects 
- Curiosity-driven builds with unclear goals

### 🗂️ Why this folder exists
Because not everything needs to be an official project.\
Some things just need a place to grow, break, get fixed, break again, and occasionally teach something useful along the way.

### ⚡ TL;DR
Nothing serious. Nothing graded.\
Just pure exploration, and small victories along the way.
