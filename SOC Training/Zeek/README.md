# Zeek Labs

## Objectives
This directory contains labs focused on **network security monitoring and traffic analysis** using **Zeek**.  
The goal is to build hands-on experience in log analysis, custom signatures, pre-written scripts, and package usage to detect, investigate, and understand network anomalies and attacker behavior.  

## Tools Used
- **Zeek** – network monitoring and analysis framework  
- **Pre-written Scripts** – for DHCP, connections, FTP, file analysis, and intelligence framework  
- **Custom Signatures** – to detect brute-force attempts, cleartext passwords, and anomalous behaviors  
- **Zeek Packages** – additional detection and enrichment (e.g., geolocation, password sniffing)  
- **PCAP Files** – captured traffic samples for analysis  
- **CyberChef / VirusTotal** – for decoding, enrichment, and malware investigation in advanced cases  

## Screenshots
Please refer to the attached screenshots in each lab’s subdirectory.
